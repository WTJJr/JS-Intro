#Intro to JavaScript

Main.js includes answers to the assigned Normal Mode homework.

hard-mode.js includes a function that takes three parameters x, y, and z. It then returns the sum of the squares of the two largest numbers. It uses if/else conditionals stacked inside each other to achieve this.

nightmare.js includes a function with one argument, n. It uses console.log to print the numbers from n down to 0 without using a for loop by using recursion (a function inside of itself), and an if/else conditional.
